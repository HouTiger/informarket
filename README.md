# Information Market
It's the game website I've written for the course ***"Computational Thoughts and Methods in Social Science"*** at Peking University.  
The idea comes from [Teaching with Networks, Crowds and Markets](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ladamic/courses/networks/si301w11/teaching/), it's a complementary in-class activity game for ***"Chaper 22: Markets and Information"*** of the book ***"Networks, Crowds and Markets"*** by **David Easley** and **Jon Kleinberg**.  
The code is allowed for using in teaching activities freely.  
Enjoy it!
